this is my custom creation of the rc4 stream cipher, but actually cryptographically secure with whitewashing and stuff. i then use it to build a file encryptor which can encrypt, decrypt files with the cipher. its cryptographically secure and it also is able to detect an incorrect key before any decryption, which makes it more secure because this doesnt leak info to an adversary. its all from scratch which was pretty fun.
